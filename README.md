A simple pastebin style python server that lets you write over http without authentication.

I wanted something like Pastebin for quick sharing between my various devices - my phone, a guest's laptop, my desktop, the kitchen computer.

You'll obviously need to have a python environment to run this.

It goes without saying but I need to really underline that there is NO AUTHENTICATION, that's kind of the idea, quick and dirty to share links and stuff back and forth without having to create user accounts and permissions.

Furthermore, it includes file upload functionality,

and

__would be trivial to exploit this for arbitrary code execution.__
